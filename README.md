A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.

Create a file named env.json in the main project file. 
Then you can use it in the main file by adding data to that file like this:

{
    "token": "BOT_TOKEN",
    "project_source": "https://github.com/xumoyunf/mukammal_son",
    "telegram": "https://t.me/@xumoyunf",
    "github": "https://github.com/xumoyunf",
    "buymeacoffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com/xumoyun",
    // and other links you can add and use from the main file
}
